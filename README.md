An accessible, comprehensive primer on Bayesian statistics specifically designed for statisticians trained in the frequentist tradition. This repository contains the complete guide along with practical code examples in Python, R, and SAS.

## 📖 About This Primer

This primer bridges the gap between frequentist and Bayesian approaches to statistics, making Bayesian methods approachable and non-intimidating. Rather than replacing your existing knowledge, it shows how Bayesian methods complement and enhance traditional statistical techniques.

### What You'll Learn

- **Philosophical Foundations**: Understanding the different interpretations of probability
- **Core Concepts**: Bayes' theorem, priors, posteriors, and the Bayesian workflow
- **Practical Applications**: Real-world examples comparing Bayesian and frequentist approaches
- **Computational Methods**: Modern tools and techniques for Bayesian analysis
- **Implementation**: Hands-on code examples in three major statistical platforms
